// There are N cities and N directed roads in Steven's world. The cities are numbered from 0 to N - 1. Steven can travel from city i to city (i + 1) % N, ( 0-> 1 -> 2 -> .... -> N - 1 -> 0).

// Steven wants to travel around the world by car. The capacity of his car's fuel tank is C gallons. There are a[i] gallons he can use at the beginning of city i and the car takes b[i] gallons to travel from city i to (i + 1) % N.

// How many cities can Steven start his car from so that he can travel around the world and reach the same city he started?

// Note

// The fuel tank is initially empty.

// Input Format

// The first line contains two integers (separated by a space): city number N and capacity C.
// The second line contains N space-separated integers: a[0], a[1], … , a[N - 1].
// The third line contains N space-separated integers: b[0], b[1], … , b[N - 1].

// Constraints

// 2 ≤ N ≤ 105
// 1 ≤ C ≤ 1018
// 0 ≤ a[i], b[i] ≤ 109

// Output Format

// The number of cities which can be chosen as the start city.

// Sample Input

// 3 3
// 3 1 2
// 2 2 2

// Sample Output

// 2

// Explanation

// Steven starts from city 0, fills his car with 3 gallons of fuel, and use 2 gallons of fuel to travel to city 1. His fuel tank now has 1 gallon of fuel.
// On refueling 1 gallon of fuel at city 1, he then travels to city 2 by using 2 gallons of fuel. His fuel tank is now empty.
// On refueling 2 gallon of fuel at city 2, he then travels back to city 0 by using 2 gallons of fuel.

// Here is the second possible solution.
// Steven starts from city 2, fill his car with 2 gallons, and travels to city 0.
// On refueling 3 gallons of fuel from city 0, he then travels to city 1, and exhausts 2 gallons of fuel. His fuel tank contains 1 gallon of fuel now. He can then refuel 1 gallon of fuel at City 1, and increase his car's fuel to 2 gallons and travel to city 2.

// However, Steven cannot start from city 1, because he is given only 1 gallon of fuel, but travelling to city 2 requires 2 gallons.

// Hence the answer 2.
